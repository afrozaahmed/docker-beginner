Hi Team,

I wanted to change the Beneficiary name i.e., my mother’s name spelling on ECard is mismatched from the name on her Aadhaar card and that’s why I am not able to get the cashless facility, not even able to get the claims.

So, can you please correct my mother’s name on ECard which is present on her Aadhaar card?

Attaching the ECard & Aadhaar card.

Correct Name – Rajiya Khatun
Aadhaa card number for your reference – 767455372394

Thanks,
Afroz Ahmed
